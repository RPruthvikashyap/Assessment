# Assessment
This project demonstrates a simple FastAPI backend with a frontend using Jinja templates. Users can upload a CSV file, map the Name and Age columns on the frontend, and the data will be saved in an SQLite database.

Choose a file, select the Name and Age columns, and click "Submit."
The data will be saved in the SQLite database, and you will see information about the uploaded file and its headers.
